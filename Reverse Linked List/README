    
The classical reverseList function (need to memorise):
def reverseList(head):
    """
    :type head: Optional[ListNode]
    :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
    """
    node = None
    while head != None:
        temp = head.next
        head.next = node
        node = head
        head = temp
    return node

In many scenarios, we need to use prev to keep track of the pointer to the 
previous element. It should normally start at prev = Listnode(0)
