"Find pairs in a sorted array / find pairs" --> reminds the use of two pointers

The key thing is to figure out the rules to shift the pointers (one or two, left or right)
Identify the constraint. Shift the constraint.

Hashmap is usually used to check for redundant results.

The key thing is the use of dictionary (or hashmaps) based on such prefix sum array.
Usually, if hashmap is used successfully, there is no need to actually create that prefix sum array.

Remove dup in a list:
list(set(ls))
If the ls contains lists, change them into tuples.

Multiple key values for hashMap:
Memory = {}
Memory[tuple([key1, key2, key3])] = value
